- createWallet API function as this call is now performed implicitly by the createSdkOutput API function (if required).

## Changes
- The getSdkOutput API function has been renamed to createSdkOutput and now will create a wallet if a wallet ID is required to be present in the SDK output and there is no pre-existing wallet.
